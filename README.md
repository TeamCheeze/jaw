# Jaw
### Introduction
Jaw is a java library, created in attempt to make a better library for all JVM developers. 
In order to remove unnecessary additional dependencies like 'kotlin stdlib' in the development environment, I decided to translate the 'kolleague' project to java, while also fixing issues and adding new features.
This library is currently under development. The first beta release is going to be released in the end of July.


### Notice
- This library is still in construction.
- ***Find the easter egg!***
